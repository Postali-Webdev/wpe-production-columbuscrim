          <h3>1. Fines</h3>
          <p>Most people think of fines in the form of traffic tickets; however, when individuals are convicted of serious crimes, they may have to pay fines that are much more substantial than a minor traffic violation. The purpose of fines is to penalize the offender, offset the cost of prosecution, and deter future crimes. Fines may be used in place of time in custody, or in combination with it. Judges have some degree of discretion when it comes to fines and a lot of factors will determine the amount, including the offense itself, its severity, your criminal history, and whether any mandatory minimums are required.</p>

          <h3>2. Sentencing</h3>
          <p>After someone is convicted or pleads guilty to a crime, a judge will impose a punishment based on several factors, including the nature of crime in question, reports by the defense and prosecution, and statements from any victims or family members. The sentence you receive can involve fines, incarceration, probation, treatment programs, house arrest, or any combination of these. While a judge has a fair amount of discretion in sentencing, there can also be mandated minimums. By working with a Columbus criminal defense attorney, you can present a case for a lighter sentence, lower fines, probation, or any other alternatives.</p>

          <h3>3. The Impact on Your Record</h3>
          <p>Unfortunately, when someone is convicted and completes the terms of their sentence, it is rarely the end of the road. Criminal convictions will typically remain on your record forever, with damaging consequences to your long-term employment, financial well-being, or even a social stigma. For example, employers will normally shy away from hiring someone with a theft conviction or DUI if the position involves handling money or driving. Additionally, securing suitable housing and financial assistance for school can be hindered depending on your record. That makes it important to carefully consider all your options with our Ohio DUI lawyers and Columbus criminal defense attorneys to understand what a conviction means in the long run.      </p>

          <h3>Misdemeanor & Felony Sentencing in Ohio</h3>
          <p>Ohio divides criminal activity into two distinct classifications, depending on the nature of the offense and its severity: misdemeanors and felonies. While both types of criminal charges are serious and should always be addressed effectively with experienced legal representation, felonies are generally considered to be much more serious than misdemeanor-level crimes. For instance, a felony conviction can result in considerable prison time, but a misdemeanor only allows for sentences to be served in local or municipal jails.</p><p>We have provided the general guidelines for sentencing between felony and misdemeanor crimes below, but this does not include the additional, collateral consequences of either conviction. For example, if you are convicted of a misdemeanor DUI, an administrative license suspension can often mean losing your job and any resulting hardships. Also, a felony sex crime conviction will likely mean registration as a sex offender and an inability to live in certain areas. </p>

          <h3>1. Pre-Trial</h3>
          <p>When you are charged with a crime, you can always explore the opportunities provided by the court system. This can be a complex process, but with an experienced attorney, you can build a successful defense strategy. Depending on your charges, you may be taken into custody. After the charges are formally filed, however, your case will be assigned to a prosecutor. You may be summoned to court later or arraigned to secure your release. The case will then move to the discovery phase and a pre-trial hearing. This provides a chance to review all the evidence, and it has the goal of determining if your case should proceed to a trial. At any time during this stage, your attorney can present arguments and motions to reduce, amend, or even dismiss the charges against you.</p>

          <h3>2. Plea Agreement Phase</h3>
          <p>This is a point where the defense and prosecution enter negotiations to hopefully find an acceptable resolution to your case, rather than going through a time-consuming and expensive trial. The prosecution’s mission will be to punish someone for a transgression, but with an articulate and persuasive attorney, you may be able to find a favorable outcome depending on your situation. This can include an agreement to plead to a less serious crime with less severe consequences, an amendment of several charges into one offense that can be more effectively dealt with, or arraigning for a sentence that considers any mitigating factors that may apply to your case.</p>

          <h3>3. Judge or Jury Trial</h3>
          <p>If your case progresses past the pre-trial and plea negotiation phases, the case will move forward and be scheduled for trial. In any criminal trial, the prosecution will have the burden of proving your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. To accomplish this, the prosecuting attorney will present their case and put forward any evidence they have that suggests your culpability. This often includes police reports any relevant lab results, witness testimony, and more. On the other hand, your Ohio DUI lawyers and Columbus criminal defense attorneys should present a case that counters, rejects, or discredits the prosecution’s arguments. Some common methods that a skilled lawyer may employ involve other theories of how the crime occurred, and disputing or finding fault with the state’s evidence.</p>

          <h3>4. Verdict</h3>
          <p>After both sides present their cases, the jury or judge will weigh the evidence put forward and evaluate its strengths, weaknesses, and ultimately makes a determination. If you are found not guilty, the matter will be closed and you can expect to either be released or excused from further concern. However, if you are found guilty, the judge will schedule a sentencing hearing where your punishment will be decided. An attorney’s advocacy skills, courtroom demeanor, and legal knowledge will be critical at every stage of this process and can greatly influence your result. Additionally, if you are convicted, a dedicated attorney will evaluate the need and the likelihood of prevailing upon appeal. This is a formal legal procedure to alter or overturn the trial decision based on mistakes or violations against your rights.</p>
